# Orchard PHP Developer Test

This project has been developed using **WordPress** and implements two main functionalities:

1. **Dynamic Banner:**  
   - Displays a banner whose background image changes dynamically based on the menu structure.  
   - The logic is implemented in the theme (or child theme) using the `[orchard_banner]` shortcode.

2. **Product of the Day:**  
   - Managed through a custom plugin that allows administrators to add, edit, and delete products.  
   - Up to 5 products can be marked as "featured" (candidates for Product of the Day).  
   - Shortcodes are available to display a random featured product or to list all products.
